        <p>Basketball is not just a game, its a lifestyle. Many people have devoted and put so much tiem and effort into this sport for a chance of being drafted. the amount of people who have given all of their life to basketball is enormous, day after day, practice after practice, game after game. Some people see people just going up and down the court with a basketball but what the players see is a battle, finding out what team is better than who. Its a battle on who will move on to the next game and who will stay behind wondering what if. Basketball is a very important sport to a lot of people. Basketball isnt just a game but its also an escape from reality. basketball will never leave your side, no matter what is happening in life basketball will always be there for you no matter the suituation
